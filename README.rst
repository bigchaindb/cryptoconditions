Crypto Conditions
=================

Python implementation of **Crypto-Conditions**. See draft of specification at
`draft-thomas-crypto-conditions-02 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-thomas-crypto-conditions-02>`_.

The RFC is also on github under
`rfcs/crypto-conditions <https://github.com/rfcs/crypto-conditions>`_.

The Crypto-Conditions specification is part of the
`Interledger Protocol (ILP) <https://interledger.org/rfcs/0003-interledger-protocol/>`_.


Motivation
----------

We would like a way to describe a signed message such that multiple actors in a
distributed system can all verify the same signed message and agree on whether
it matches the description.

This provides a useful primitive for distributed, event-based systems since we
can describe events (represented by signed messages) and therefore define
generic authenticated event handlers.


Installation
------------
