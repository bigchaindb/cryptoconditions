        PREIMAGE-SHA-256: Hashlock condition using SHA-256.

        This type of condition is also called a hashlock. By creating a hash
        of a difficult-to-guess 256-bit random or pseudo-random integer it
        is possible to create a condition which the creator can trivially
        fulfill by publishing the random value. However, for anyone else,
        the condition is cryptgraphically hard to fulfill, because they
        would have to find a preimage for the given condition hash.

        PREIMAGE-SHA-256 is assigned the type ID 0. It relies on the SHA-256
        and PREIMAGE feature suites which corresponds to a feature bitmask
        of 0x03.

        The preimage is the only input to a SHA256 hashlock condition.

        Note that the preimage should contain enough (pseudo-random) data in order
        to be difficult to guess. A sufficiently large secret seed and a
        cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator (CSPRNG) can be
        used to avoid having to store each individual preimage.
