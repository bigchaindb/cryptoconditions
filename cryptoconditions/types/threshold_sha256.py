        THRESHOLD-SHA-256: Threshold gate condition using SHA-256.

        Threshold conditions can be used to create m-of-n multi-signature groups.

        Threshold conditions can represent the AND operator by setting the threshold
        to equal the number of subconditions (n-of-n) or the OR operator by setting the thresold to one (1-of-n).

        Threshold conditions allows each subcondition to carry an integer weight.

        Since threshold conditions operate on conditions, they can be nested as well
        which allows the creation of deep threshold trees of public keys.

        By using Merkle trees, threshold fulfillments do not need to to provide the
        structure of unfulfilled subtrees. That means only the public keys that are
        actually used in a fulfillment, will actually appear in the fulfillment, saving space.

        One way to formally interpret threshold conditions is as a boolean weighted
        threshold gate. A tree of threshold conditions forms a boolean weighted
        threhsold circuit.

        THRESHOLD-SHA-256 is assigned the type ID 2. It relies on the SHA-256 and
        THRESHOLD feature suites which corresponds to a feature bitmask of 0x09.

        Threshold determines the weighted threshold that is used to consider this condition
        fulfilled. If the added weight of all valid subfulfillments is greater or
        equal to this number, the threshold condition is considered to be fulfilled.
