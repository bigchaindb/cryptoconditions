=====

Cryptoconditions consist of a simple conecept: 'conditions' need to be 'fulfilled' in order to be accepted.
Several types on conditions exists. The fulfillment of a condition depends on its type and comes in different requirements.

An overview of different condition types and their corresponding fulfillments is given in the following paragraphs and sections.
The formal definition can be found in the `formal definitions in the cryptocondition draft <https://tools.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-thomas-crypto-conditions-03#section-7.3>`_

Conditions & Fulfillments Types

The following condition & fulfillment pairs exist:

- Ed25519-SHA256
