    Crypto-condition.

    A primary design goal of crypto-conditions was to keep the size of conditions
    constant. Even a complex multi-signature can be represented by the same size
    condition as a simple hashlock.

    However, this means that a condition only carries the absolute minimum
    information required. It does not tell you anything about its structure.

    All that is included with a condition is the fingerprint (usually a hash of
    the parts of the fulfillment that are known up-front, e.g. public keys), the
    maximum fulfillment size, the set of features used and the condition type.

    This information is just enough that an implementation can tell with
    certainty whether it would be able to process the corresponding fulfillment.
